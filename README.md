# Virtual-Home-Lab

## Objective

The Virtual Home Lab project was developed to create a flexible, cost-effective environment for learning, testing, and practicing cybersecurity, networking, and system administration concepts. This self-hosted lab setup allowed for safe experimentation with real-world scenarios such as network attacks, system hardening, service deployment, and monitoring — all within a virtualized infrastructure.

### Skills Learned
-Proficiency in setting up and managing virtualized environments.

-Familiarity with hypervisors, virtual networking, and storage configurations.

-Hands-on experience with various operating systems (Linux, Windows).

-Setup and testing of cybersecurity tools and monitoring systems.

-Ability to simulate real-world network scenarios, attacks, and defenses.

-Improved troubleshooting, system configuration, and log analysis skills.

### Tools Used
-VirtualBox / VMware Workstation / Proxmox – for managing virtual machines.

-pfSense / OPNsense – for firewall and network segmentation.

-Kali Linux / Metasploitable / Windows Server – for attack and defense scenarios.

-Wireshark, Burp Suite, Nmap, Nessus – for traffic analysis and vulnerability assessments.

-ELK Stack / Graylog / Splunk Free – for log aggregation and monitoring.

-Git / GitHub – for configuration backup and version control.
